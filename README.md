# Lending Club Case Study

- Lending Club is a consumer finance company which specializes in lending various types of loans to urban customers. 
- When the company receives a loan application, the company has to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile. 
- Two types of risks are associated with the bank’s decision:
	- If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company.
	- If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company.
- Company provided historical data to find out the defaulters pattern.
